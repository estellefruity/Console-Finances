# Console-Finances
JavaScript Challenge: <br>Console Finances <br>
Overview<br>
In this challenge, you'll be using the concepts you've learned to complete the required activity.
This activity presents a real-world situation in which your newfound JavaScript skills will come in
handy. You are tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company. You
have been provided with a financial dataset in the starter/index.js file.<br>

1. Create a new GitHub repo called Console-Finances . Then, clone it to your computer.<br>
2. Copy the starter files in your local git repository.<br>
You have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.<br>
Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:<br>
The total number of months included in the dataset.<br>
The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.<br>
The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.<br>
You will need to track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month
and then find the average.<br>
( Total/(Number of months - 1) )<br>
The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire
period.<br>
The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire
period.<br>
